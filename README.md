# RFID-Attendance-System
An RFID-based attendance system leverages Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to streamline and automate the process of tracking attendance. Each individual is provided with an RFID card or tag that contains a unique identifier. When the card is scanned by an RFID reader, the system records the attendance data instantly.

**WORKING PRINCIPLE :-**

*RFID Tag and Reader:*

Each individual is issued an RFID tag/card with a unique identifier. 

*Scanning Process:*

As the individual scans their RFID tag at the reader, the tag's unique identifier is captured by the reader.

*Data Logging:*

The attendance data (including the unique identifier and timestamp) is logged into Google Sheets or Excel.

*Google Sheets Integration:*

Real-Time Update: Data is updated in real-time, accessible from anywhere with internet connectivity.
Collaboration: Multiple users can access and manage the data simultaneously.

*Storage and Reporting:*

The logged data is stored securely in Google Sheets (cloud-based) or Excel (local/online), allowing for easy backup, retrieval, and reporting.
